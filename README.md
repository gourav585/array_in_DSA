<h3>Key points:</h3>
<h4>Fixed Size:</h4>
The size of an array is determined at compile time and cannot be changed during runtime.
<h3>Same Type:</h3>
All elements within an array must be of the same data type (e.g., int, double, char, etc.).
<h3>Contiguous Memory:</h3>
Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access using their index.
