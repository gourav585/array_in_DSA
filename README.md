definition of array
<div>
  In C++, an array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. 
Key points:
Fixed Size:
The size of an array is determined at compile time and cannot be changed during runtime.
Same Type:
All elements within an array must be of the same data type (e.g., int, double, char, etc.).
Contiguous Memory:
Array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access using their index.
